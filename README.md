# Tic-Tac-Toe
Purpose: create a simple tic tac toe game in C++. 

The game is design by creating two initial players. Each player takes a turn placing a mark (X or y) on the on a matrix array graph. When a player chooses  where to place their mark, the location will be replaced with their mark. 

The winner is decided by a function that returns a 0 or 1. The function inspects the board and process its contents through an “else if”  tree statement to see if there is a math. If there’s no match it’ll return a 0, if there is a wining match it’ll return a 1
